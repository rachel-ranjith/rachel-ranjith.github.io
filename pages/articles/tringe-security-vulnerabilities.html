                <p class="article-subtitle">Tringe.org's security flaws raise questions about automated app development and student data protection.</p>

                <p>Within an hour of creating an account on Tringe.org, "the dating app: by Trinners, for Trinners," two Trinity students uncovered serious security vulnerabilities that left sensitive user data exposed to anyone who created an account on the platform.</p>

                <aside class="pull-quote">
                    <p>"We were able to access or query all the user profiles," one student explained, "Even with a deleted account."</p>
                </aside>

                <p>The students, who wish to remain anonymous, found they could access comprehensive user profiles, including names, ages, sexuality, hometown, course details, dating prompts, languages, and profile photographs. The data was stored in a way that made highly sensitive information, such as sexual orientation, queryable by any registered user.</p>

                <p>The vulnerabilities stemmed from fundamental architectural issues as all database queries ran client-side rather than server-side, allowing users to execute their own queries once logged in.</p>

                <p>The security flaws appear to be a direct consequence of the app's development method. Tringe.org was built using an AI-powered "vibe coding" platform that generates applications from text prompts. "It's all prompted," one student confirmed after examining the source code. "The way that the app architecture works, all of the database querying code is all client-side, which allows us to do things like this."</p>

                <p>The students immediately disclosed their findings to the app's creator, who has been receptive to fixing the issues. So far, email addresses have been hidden, though most other personal information remains accessible. However, the students believe the problems are "symptomatic of the actual platform" rather than easily fixable bugs.</p>

                <p>The case raises broader concerns about AI-generated code and student tech projects. Similar AI-powered coding platforms have been linked to data leaks. A notable example is the Tea app, which had a large scale data breach in late July. This further highlights fundamental issues with AI-generated coding for production-level applications.</p>

                <aside class="pull-quote">
                    <p>"I would, as a baseline, never trust something that was purely written by AI with data," one student stated.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>The other added, "Don't believe the hype of AI taking software jobs. If this is any indication, there's still a long way to go."</p>

                <p>While the app's creator has shown willingness to address security concerns, questions remain about whether platforms handling sensitive student data should be deployed without proper security review.</p>

                <p>The students emphasised they did not actively exploit the vulnerabilities beyond confirming they existed. However, they noted that anyone with a Trinity email could potentially access the same information, requiring only basic technical knowledge.</p>

                <p>When an app's creator relies entirely on AI-generated code, troubleshooting and securing that code becomes difficult without traditional programming expertise.</p>

                <p>The students stressed they are not dictating what users should do with this information but strongly encourage students to fully understand the security implications before sharing personal data on any platform, particularly those built entirely through AI automation.</p>
