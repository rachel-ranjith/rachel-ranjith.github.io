            <div class="article-content">
                
                <p class="article-subtitle">Ireland's Online Safety Code puts X's age verification systems, and the future of platform accountability, under the microscope.</p>

                <p>X (formerly Twitter) has found itself at the centre of a regulatory clash with Ireland's media watchdog, Coimisiún na Meán, over its failure to implement age verification systems in line with the country's newly enforced Online Safety Code.</p>
                
                <p>The Code, which took effect on 21 July 2025, mandates that video-sharing platforms allowing access to pornography or other harmful content must implement "effective age assurance measures". It also requires platforms to have parental controls in place and prohibits content that promotes self-harm, eating disorders, suicide, or dangerous online challenges. Companies that fail to comply risk fines of up to €20m or 10% of their global turnover.</p>
                
                <p>After reviewing X's platform, Coimisiún na Meán released a statement noting that it had seen no evidence of compliance with the Code and issued a deadline for the submission of a response. It also raised concerns about X's lack of parental control features.</p>
                
                <p>X soon issued a response, detailing the age assurance systems it plans to implement. According to a post in their Help Center, the company intends to use a layered system. This includes "existing signals" such as legacy verified accounts, account age, user email addresses, and social connections to estimate a user's age. If those are inconclusive, the user will be prompted to either submit a live selfie for facial recognition analysis or upload a government-issued ID.</p>
                
                <p>The move comes after X lost a High Court challenge against the Online Safety Code. The company had argued that the Code represented "regulatory overreach", claiming it went beyond what is required under the EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The Court disagreed. Mr Justice Conleth Bradley found that the provisions of the Code fell within the Irish government's legal authority and did not conflict with the EU's Digital Services Act.</p>

                <aside class="pull-quote">
                    <p>This outcome will shape how far states can go in reining in tech giants.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>As of now, the regulator has acknowledged receipt of X's compliance plans; however, it has not yet confirmed whether these changes meet the required standards.</p>
                
                <p>The case has drawn attention to the broader tension between content regulation, child safety, and data protection in digital spaces. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has weighed in cautiously, noting the importance of age verification while warning that any method used must be proportional and respect privacy.</p>
                
                <p>That is where X's proposed system has drawn scrutiny. Facial recognition and ID scanning may be effective at confirming age, but they raise concerns around data collection, biometric storage, and third-party processing. For regulators and privacy advocates, the use of such intrusive verification methods is not easily accepted. The company has stated that its third-party providers will be subject to strict privacy standards, and further updates will be made to its data handling practices.</p>

                <aside class="pull-quote">
                    <p>However, in the rush to comply, platforms should not allow the normalization of invasive tech.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>The introduction of Ireland's Online Safety Code represents one of the first attempts by a national regulator to enforce the EU's broader goals under the Digital Services Act. Ireland's position is significant—as home to the European headquarters of major tech companies including Meta, Google, TikTok, and X, the state holds unique regulatory responsibilities for enforcing key EU digital legislation. The outcome of this case could influence how other countries approach compliance enforcement and whether similar frameworks are adopted elsewhere.</p>
                
                <p>Still, questions remain. The Code leaves room for interpretation on what constitutes "effective" age assurance. X's system relies partly on inference-based methods that may not accurately assess users' ages in all cases. It also gives the company a level of discretion in determining when to prompt for more invasive verification.</p>
                
                <p>This grey area has led to concerns that platforms could technically meet the Code's requirements while still exposing underage users to harmful content or collecting more data than necessary. Privacy advocates have flagged this as a key issue, suggesting that compliance should not mean simply ticking boxes, but demonstrating meaningful protection.</p>
                
                <p>For now, X maintains that it is prioritising the rollout of its age assurance systems. "We are fully committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Irish Online Safety Code," a spokesperson said. "Child safety is a top priority." The proposed system is still up for review. The question is whether X's approach strikes the right balance between user protection and privacy. And more broadly, whether Coimisiún na Meán—and, by extension, EU law—can compel platforms to make structural changes rather than retrofitting compliance after the fact.</p>

                <aside class="pull-quote">
                    <p>Regulation only works if it forces platforms to change how they operate and not just how they present themselves.</p>
                </aside>

                <p>Will fines and legal losses translate to meaningful shifts in platform behaviour? Or will companies continue to shape the terms of compliance to fit their existing models? The Commission's response in the coming weeks will provide one of the clearest answers yet.</p>
